## Introduction

Melanoma is a severe form of skin cancer with a high mortality rate if not detected early. Traditional manual assessments by dermatologists can be time-consuming and subject to bias. This project explores the development of a CNN-based system that analyzes images of moles to distinguish between benign and malignant melanomas based on characteristics such as color and texture. This automated detection approach aims to improve diagnostic efficiency and support dermatologists in providing timely and accurate prognoses.

## Objectives

1. **Develop a CNN Model**: Create a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting melanoma.
2. **Analyze Features**: Identify distinguishing features in moles, such as color intensity (redness or black) and irregular patterns, indicative of melanoma.
3. **Assist Medical Diagnosis**: Provide an efficient, unbiased tool to assist physicians in diagnosing melanoma accurately and promptly.

## Dataset

The dataset includes labeled images of benign and malignant moles used to train, validate, and test the model. Each image is preprocessed and labeled according to its diagnostic category.

- **Classes**: Benign and malignant melanoma.
- **Features Analyzed**: Color (red or black), texture, and irregularity.

*Note: Replace with specific dataset details if needed (e.g., source, size, preprocessing steps).*

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to capture critical features from mole images.

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract feature maps that help identify distinguishing characteristics of melanoma.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality and retain essential features.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the images based on learned features.
4. **Activation Function**: Uses ReLU in hidden layers and softmax or sigmoid in the output layer for binary classification.

The model achieves approximately 90% accuracy in detecting melanoma, making it a promising tool for assisting in medical diagnostics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
